                                Angular v16 &v17
                             =====================
Why angular 16?
Angular is a frontend Framework.Angular is an application-design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps(SPA's)- SPA means page will not reload

What is scope of Angular in present market?
In present market Angular stays second after react but still Angular is more stable than React.
JQuery is mostly used before angular nd react.

History of Angular:
Angular is developed and maintained by Google.
In 2010, Google developed a frontEnd Framework called Angular JS which is based on Javascript, but it can't be used as wide because of its complexity. In 2012, Google signed agrement with Microsoft and brought Angular with TypeSscript, then they name it as Angular or Angular+ or Angular 2 which is based on TS.

Recent versions of Angular: Nov 8,2023 version 17
Every Version Angular will add some features.
In Companies, mostly Angular 9, Angular 13 or Angular 15 only will be there.

what are the differences between angular and React?
FrameWorks consists files,routing,forms,ui etc..,Developer World.
Library means just a predefined logic/code for specific Purpose
                               Angular                               React
===================================================
        Angular is a FrontEnd Framework       React is just a UI Library
       Less dependency with other libraries    mostly dependent with other libraries
         Angular is built and support with TS   React goes with JS or TS
         Angular is developed by Google          React is developed by Facebook
                                                                       framework of react like NextJS

JAVASCRIPT
==========
Just in time(JIT) compiler which is used to give functionalities to web pages

Static data typing,java,.net
JS is dynamic data typing
Java:
 int a=10;
a="raj";wrong

JS:
let a=10;
a="raj"
a=true
/* primitive number,string,boolean,null,undefined, non-primitive array,functions,objects,sets,maps,date*/

for example, e-commerce , u will have so many values from backend, if by mistake backend sends price as a string

if i add type checking to javascript, it is called typescript


Today's task is find differences betweeen let,var and const in JS

To do this course,

VS Code- code editor
https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Download and install

Create a dummy folder and start basic html and js for practise,connect html and js

shortcut for html template is ! + enter

Extensions: need to install entensions Live Server

Assignment : learn what is hoisting and how js works?

what is typeScript?
Typescript is a superset of JS.TypeScript is used to provide type check to javascript
https://www.typescriptlang.org/

is js compiles or not?
JS interpreted in browser. line by line 
JS Uses OOP concepts but not pure OOP

How to start TypeScript?
  step 1: go to https://nodejs.org/en and download and install nodejs
step 2: check node js installed properly or not by opening command prompt and enter the command node -v

step 3: After checking that npm is installed, go to command propmt and type "npm install -g typescript"

step 4: to check whether typescript installed properly or not, type "tsc -v".

what is npm?
node package manager . In internet there will be thousands of packages/libraries.npm can install any package you need or uninstall any package you want . Alternatives are yarn,PIP or pnpm

For Angular ,TS Mandatory
to install ts, first install npm

Typescript cannot be understand by browser. typescript compiler will conver tyescript into javascript

Package.json:==> Any project , npm mainly check package.json, package.json contains meta data,mostly dependencies packages will be used

For example, If i used bootstrap in my project, then package.json will note down that you used bootstrap with its version
command: npm init -y

Package-lock.json==> it provides meta data of package.json

node modules===> it is folder where your package will be downloaded

To create tsconfig.json, command is  npx tsc --init 
config files means set of rules.
same way, tsconfig means set of rules of typescript compiler




Features:
Static Data Typing:- it means you can declare the types of variables,function parameters or function return types. Typescript system will understand the data type and will catch error

IDESupport: it provide support for all code editors and IDEs

Type Inference: it means typescript has the capability to recognize the type without declaring data type

Rich EcoSystem: it has growing Ecosystem and many tools were supporting it

Tyoescript check errors in compile time





tsc will compile typescript code and convert into js
actual procedure in any application is , first we will install package, npm install package-name after that u will use it. in case u want to use package but without installing it then u will give npx 


commands:
create ts file and write some basic js and in terminal give command "npx tsc --init" in specified path
next, in terminal , give command " npx tsc filename"

Typescript follows type annotations(u will give type) and type inference(it will only guess the type)
let a:number=10======>type annotation
let b=10===> type inference
